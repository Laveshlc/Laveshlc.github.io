Hello, I'm Lavesh, and I'm passionate about all things cybersecurity. I currently hold several certifications in the field, all practical and hands-on focused, equipping me with the skills to tackle real-world cybersecurity challenges effectively. I currently hold the following certifications:

- [Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)](https://www.credential.net/ffb0af88-aa7f-40e4-8b34-2fb02ccf4c45#gs.4cfvut)
- [Certified Red Team Operator (CRTO)](https://eu.badgr.com/public/assertions/B_q4I0EeSpiloRukuDHFlg)
- [Certified Red Team Expert (CRTE)](https://www.credential.net/fa6d5675-1932-4c22-9f98-ede06e76bbd5#gs.4cfwfe)
- [Certified Red Team Professional (CRTP)](https://www.credential.net/9805b6ca-43f9-49a2-8d1d-3090a82df230#gs.4cg07b)
- [Blue Team Level 1 (BTL1)](https://www.credly.com/badges/d183eff0-a425-4cd8-91e1-69723ac772eb/)

In addition to my certifications, I find enjoyment in working through Hack The Box prolabs, which are designed as capture the flag exercises within a simulated enterprise network. To date, I have successfully completed both the [Zephyr](https://github.com/Laveshlc/Laveshlc/blob/main/Zephyr.pdf) and [Rastalabs](https://github.com/Laveshlc/Laveshlc/blob/main/RastaLabs.pdf) pro labs.

My journey in cybersecurity began with a keen interest in comprehending the inner workings of computer systems and networks. As time progressed, I delved deeper into the realm of red teaming and penetration testing. Achieving the OSCP certification marked a significant milestone in my path, and I am currently striving towards acquiring the Offsec Experienced Penetration Tester (OSEP) certification to further elevate my skill set.

I believe in continuous learning and staying up-to-date with the latest security trends and techniques. I have extensive experience in exploiting and assessing vulnerabilities, along with recommending effective remediation strategies.

I would like to start blogging to reinforce my learning and provide valuable insights to help others in the cybersecurity community.

Feel free to connect with me on social media or via email if you'd like to discuss anything related to cybersecurity or just want to chat!

Thank you for visiting my page, and I hope you find my content valuable.
