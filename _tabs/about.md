Hello, I'm Lavesh, and I'm passionate about all things cybersecurity. I currently hold several certifications in the field, all practical and hands-on focused, equipping me with the skills to tackle real-world cybersecurity challenges effectively:

- Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)
- Certified Red Team Operator (CRTO)
- Certified Red Team Expert (CRTE)
- Certified Red Team Professional (CRTP)
- Blue Team Level 1 (BTL1)

My journey in cybersecurity started with a keen interest in understanding how computer systems and networks work. Over time, I delved deeper into the world of red teaming and penetration testing. Obtaining the OSCP certification was a significant milestone for me, and I'm currently working towards achieving the Offensive Security Experienced Penetration Tester (OSEP) certification to further enhance my skills.

I believe in continuous learning and staying up-to-date with the latest security trends and techniques. I have extensive experience in exploiting and assessing vulnerabilities, along with recommending effective remediation strategies.

I would like to start blogging to reinforce my learning and provide valuable insights to help others in the cybersecurity community.

Feel free to connect with me on social media or via email if you'd like to discuss anything related to cybersecurity or just want to chat!

Thank you for visiting my page, and I hope you find my content valuable.
